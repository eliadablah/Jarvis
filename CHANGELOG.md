# Changelog

## 2026-10-15

### Repo - Initial public structure

- Added the README, setup guide, and dev/prod environment plan (`jarvis.eliadablah.com`, reachable only on my private network).
- Added `config/backtalk.json.example` with placeholder paths.
- Added `.gitignore` so the upstream kit folders, real settings, Jarvis's private boot file, and secrets stay out of git.

### Voice - Ask-first permissions

- Changed backtalk `permission_mode` from `bypassPermissions` to `ask`, so Jarvis asks out loud before any real action.
